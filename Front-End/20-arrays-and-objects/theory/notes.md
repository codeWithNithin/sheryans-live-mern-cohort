# Arrays and objects

### Agenda

1. What is an Array?
2. How to create Arrays?


- in normal variable we cant sore more than 1 value.
- inorder to store 10 values of same thing, we had to create 10 variables to do this.
- let a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, etc..
- instead we can create a array where we can keep more than 1 variable.
- ex: arr = [1,2,3,4]
- Array is a data structure which we can store all values at one place.
